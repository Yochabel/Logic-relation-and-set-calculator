# Logic-relation-and-set-calculator
This program is made up of 3 calculators, which are:

-LOGIC CALCULATOR
You have 3 primitive statements (p,q,r) and you can use from 1 to 3 statements.
The calculator does the following:
1) Print the truth table of a compound proposition with all the necessary columns so that only one operation is performed on each column, until reaching the compound proposition entered by the user.
2) Check if 2 compound propositions are logically equivalent
3) Determine if a proposition is a tautology or a contradiction

-SET CALCULATOR
This calculator will work with 2 sets of integers with cardinality from 0 to 20, with elements in the range 1 to 100.
The calculator does the following:
1) The user is asked if he wants to enter the elements manually or if he prefers that the sets be generated randomly.
2) Ask about the size of the sets. They are generated or introduced, depending on the case. It must be clear how the elements (put instructions).
3) A menu of possible operations is displayed, which are:
1. Intercept A∩B
2. Junction A∪B
3. Difference A-B
4. Difference B-A
5. Symmetric difference
6. A's Complement
7. Complement of B
8. Cartesian product AxB
9. Cartesian product BxA
10. Cartesian product AxA
11. Cartesian product BxB
12. Power set A
13. Power set B
14. Cardinality of A
15. Cardinality of B
16. Containment A⊆B (True or False)
17. Containment B⊆A (True or False)
18. Exit
4) The result of the selected operation is printed for cases 1 to 15, or true or false for options 16 and 17

-RATIO CALCULATOR

In a menu, the user decides if he wants to work with a set that he introduces himself or if it is generated randomly. This set is composed of 1 to 20 natural numbers (in a range from 1 to 100). Then another menu must be displayed in which one of at least 5 relationships can be chosen.
The calculator will generate all the ordered pairs that satisfy the relation from the Cartesian product of the sets and will show them. It will also determine if the relation is reflexive, symmetric and/or transitive and prints it on the screen.
